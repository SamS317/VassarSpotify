# Usability 

The viewing panes should be easy to use and slick, with a nice simple design.

There shouldn't be too many buttons or actions on the screen at the same time, because we want the user to not be overwhelmed.

Searching for songs should bring up the users preferences first, then the most popular.

The program must take the form of an android appliation.
