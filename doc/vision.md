# Vision Document

## Vision Statement

>For people who want to listen to music and be an artist of their own, Vassar Spotify (NAME WILL CHANGE) is an Android 
> based application that allows users to upload personally recorded songs and listen to top hits. Unlike existing apps 
> that aren't integrated with song creation and top hit listening, our product will provide a platform that allows easy 
> integration between the two. Another feature we would like to add to our application is the ability to meet new people.
> A sort of "Tinder" type application will be made available in which you can be matched up with other profiles and 
> have a chat! You can choose between making friends or possibly something more. A built-in chat service will allow users
> to instantly communicate with users.
