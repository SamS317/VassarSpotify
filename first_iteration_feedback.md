- Vision
  Not detailed enough. Is missing the subsections we went through in lecture, such as a table of actors and their goals.


- Use cases

    - Regarding the brief use cases:
        - The "happy path" scenario should be listed for each use case, not just a one sentence description of what it is about.
        - Unclear what "tinder specific" is referring to. Doesn't sound like a use case.
        - Functional decomposition is reasonable but the functionality needed to tie all the pieces together seems to be missing. What does the main screen of the app look like? There should be a use case for that, like "View dashboard", or something? Also, there is no functionality to create a profile, or should view profile be "manage profile" instead?
        - The simple playback actions could be grouped in a "Manage playback" use case, with extensions for skip, rewind, pause, etc.


  - Regarding the fully-dressed use cases:
    - Formatting note: using sub-sections instead of nested lists would make the use cases easier to read.
    - Pre and postconditions are not clearly identified. The extension points are not connected to particular steps. Overall they're poorly organized and hard to read.
    - The workflow steps should be either the system processing or outputting something, or the user providing some input to the system. It should read like a dialogue between the system and the user.


- Iteration plan
    - This is good, shows thought was put into it. I'd encourage you to start with the song upload (although the actual upload will be a mockup) and then search. This will force you to think about the metadata needed for each song, so that it can be searched for.

- General comments

    - Overall more effort should have been put into this submission. Please revise, particularly your use cases, according to the feedback provided. I know you can do great things, and want to see you fulfill your potential. I am also concerned you didn't come to lab, where you could have received guidance on how to improve your submission.
