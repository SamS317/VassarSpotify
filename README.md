# Vassar Spotify by Connor Machado and Sam Shurin

## Project Description
>Vassar Spotify is an Android based music platform in which you can play top songs from hit artists. Our current implementation allows you to play songs with all of the generic functionality such as skipping, replaying, and of course pausing the song. You can also Create your very own playlists



## Functionality
>Current functionality includes logging in, creating account, searching for a song or artist, and playing a song, pausing a song, skipping and replaying a song, and listening to the top hits


### Creating an account
>Creating an account will need a username and a password, and each are stored in the profile class.


### Logging in
>Logging in will require a matching username and password, both of which are stored in a database using Google's Cloud Firestore


### Searching for song/artist
>Searching for a song or artist requires the user to input the song they want, and the Controller will return a list of closely resembled songs


### Playing a song
>Playing a song requires the user to first search for a song, then they can choose from a list of songs that our program chose to best fit the query. Or you can search an empty query and obtain the full list of songs in the songdatabase


## How to run
> The app should run like any other, you open it up and you are in and having fun!
